=== {name} Image

The base image is built from a Alpine based image from Microsoft that has PowerShell installed. This is helps to keep the images as small as possible and has PowerShell installed for the Independent Runner module.

The following table shows the packages that are installed by the Alpine Package Manager (APK). These apps are installed to assist with the installation of other applications that are not in the Alpine application repositories.

==== Application Notes

===== AZ CLI

As we are installing the AZ CLI as a package from PIP, it will not not setup the `az` command in the PATH. A shim, called `az`, is installed in the image and placed in `/usr/bin/`. This means that it is in a directory that is in the PATH so can be easily called from the command line.

[source,bash]
