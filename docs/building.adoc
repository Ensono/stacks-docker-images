== Building Images

As seen in the <<docker-image-dependencies>> image, all of the Docker images that are built for use with the Independent Runner are based on a hierarchy. This means that they need to be built in the correct order. All of the tasks are set in Taskctl.

The images are all built using the EIR, however the first two images are built ont he local machine or the agent. This is so that there is no dependency on previously built images.

When publishing to Docker Hub, it is possible to push an overview file as well. The build script takes the path to the `Dockerfile.ubuntu` file and uses that to determine the path to the README file that should be pushed to Docker Hub.

NOTE: The README file is generated by the documentation build step.
