=== {name} Image

The DotNet image is based off the Java image. This is because we use Sonarqube to run tests for the .NET apps. Sonarqube has a dependency in Java when it performs the tests. Originally OpenJDK was installed, however we made the decision to use the Java image so that we have consistency across the images.
