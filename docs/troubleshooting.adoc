== Troubleshooting

=== When using the `--load` command the error "docker exporter does not currently support exporting manifest lists" is output.

This happens when the default mode of creating multiple architectures is used with the `--load` command. When using `--push` this is not an issue, however when push is disabled this error will be thrown.
