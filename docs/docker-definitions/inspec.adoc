== EIR Inspec

So that we can detect configuration drift from what we expect to have deployed and track versions of applications (such as Kubernetes) we use Inspec[https://inspec.io].

This is bundled as a separate image that can be called to run infrastructure tests. An example of such tests can be found in the Stacks Infrastructure AKS repository - https://github.com/Ensono/stacks-infrastructure-aks/tree/master/deploy/tests.

=== Specs

**Platforms**: `linux/amd64`, `linux/arm64`
