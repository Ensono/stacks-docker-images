== EIR Foundation Azure CLI

The Azure CLI is a large application that is used to manipulate resources in Azure. It is in its own image so that it can be used as a base image for other container images, such as `data`.

The CLI can be added to, for example the `datafactory` extension.

The image is built from the Ensono PowerShell image.
