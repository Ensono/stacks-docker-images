== EIR Foundation Tools

The image is used as a library from which software tools can be copied into other images as required. The image is built from the `enonso/eir-foundation-powershell` image.

All applications are installed by copying and then running the `files/install.sh` script. By installing the applications in this way the number of `RUN` statements in the Dockerfile is reduced.

NOTE: The table above only shows the download links for X64 machines, not ARM64 packages.

Two versions of Terraform are installed. This is to support migration of Terraform from one version to another. Version `1.5.7` is configured as the default version, using a symlink to the `/usr/local/terraform/1.5.7/bin` directory.
