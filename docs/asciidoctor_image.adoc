AsciiDoctor is used to generate the documents in many projects in Stacks. It is akin to Markdown but provides many more features that allow the use of cross-referencing and contents tables to name but two.

AsciiDoctor is another tool that is based on Ruby and as a result it is kept isolated in containers. The base image used is Java, this is because there are some tools that require Java to provide additional functionality in AsciiDoctor.

NOTE: Hugo is a static site generator that understands AsciiDoc files. However Hugo requires Go to operate correctly. As it does not require additional libraries to work, the Go binary for Alpine is installed.

NOTE: This image is heavily influenced by this https://github.com/asciidoctor/docker-asciidoctor repo
